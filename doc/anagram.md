### Anagrams

When two or more words are composed of the same characters, but in a different
order, they are called anagrams. Write a function`(find-anagrams dictionary word)` that will find
all possible anagrams for the given string in a given dictionary.

Sample anagram:

```
"Madam Curie" = "Radium came"
```

#### Testing notes

The test harness passes a filename to `dictionary` and a string to `word`.

Results are expected as a list of strings as they appear in the dictionary.
