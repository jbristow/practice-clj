# practice-clj

A Clojure library of katas and simple problems to keep me sharp.

This is using the katas and some of the algorithms from
[plutov/practice-go](https://github.com/plutov/practice-go) and is intended to
be following along in the same manner in Clojure instead of go. If you consider
starring this repo, please star plutov's repo first.

## Usage

Load namespaces in the repl or test changes via `lein test`.
